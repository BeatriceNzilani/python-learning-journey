My personal journey learning Python from beginner to advanced. 🚀

# 🐍 Nzilani's Python Playground 🌱

Hi there! 👋  
Welcome to my Python learning repo — a space where I practice, play, and grow . I'm learning everything from the ground up, and documenting my journey step by step. Feel free to explore, learn with me, or give feedback 💬

## 📍 What’s This Repo About?

This is where I:
- Practice Python basics 💡  
- Solve coding exercises 🔧  
- Build fun mini projects 🎮  
- Track my weekly progress ✅  

I’m learning through videos, articles, and real code — no boring theory dumps here 😄
